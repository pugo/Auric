# ROMS

The emulator looks for ROM files in this directory. 

It expects the following ROM files to exist.

| ROM file name  | Description                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| `basic10.rom`  | Oric 1 ROM (for Oric 1 mode)       |
| `basic11b.rom` | Oric Atmos ROM (for Atmos mode)    |
| `microdis.rom` | For Microdisc disc drive emulation |

The above names are the commonly existing names, as used by other emulators. 

I plan to add a configuration file options to specify ROM locations and ROM file names in the future.
